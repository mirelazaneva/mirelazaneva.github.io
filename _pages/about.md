I am a scientist trained in clinical and cognitive psychology. I research how poverty and inequality affect our minds and behaviours.
I currently hold a post-doctoral research fellowship at Christ Church College, University of Oxford.

My research includes both theoretical and empirical streams, such as questions about how we should measure poverty, whether and how our analytical choices matter, which anti-poverty and developmental interventions are most promising, how stigma associated with  poverty and mental ill health can be effectively addressed, how communities and researchers can best work together through participatory and mutuality practices. I have a keen interest in new quantitative methods and often combine statistical methods from a range of disciplines, such as social epidemiology, behavioral genetics, and economics with diverse cross-sectional and longitudinal datasets. Ultimately, I hope my research will help inform effective interventions and policies in the context of poverty alleviation and global mental health.

Iâ€™m also interested in meta science and neurodiversity. You can read more about my research here.
